      title: 'Introduction'
      paragraph:
        1-1: 'The overall objective of the ‘Using Remote Sensing in support of solutions to reduce agricultural water
              productivity gaps’ project of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) supported by the Ministry of
              Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands (DGIS) is to achieve future food security with less water, while using
              water resources in a sustainable manner. Agriculture is a key water user and a careful monitoring of water
              productivity in agriculture is a necessity. The FAO Water Productivity Open Access portal (WaPOR)
              provides new opportunities to exploit spatial information related to water consumption in agriculture and
              water productivity for Africa and Near East. Assessing sustainable use of water resources is evaluated
              using the water accounting framework, utilising a combination of remote sensing data (in this case the
              WaPOR database) open access global datasets and complemented with local measurements on weather
              conditions and river flows.'
        1-2: 'The Litani River basin is one of the selected pilot basins for making a more comprehensive assessment of
              the multiple water user situation (see Figure 1 for location of the Litani basin). The assessment would
              contribute to better understanding the possible consequences of water productivity increases on other
              water users. A secondary objective is to demonstrate the value of the WaPOR database in preparing water
              accounts for river basins.'
